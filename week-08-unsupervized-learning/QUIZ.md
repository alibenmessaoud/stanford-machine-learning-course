Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

Correct 

Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning.

Correct 

In unsupervised learning, you are given an unlabeled dataset and are asked to find "structure" in the data.

Correct 

Clustering is the only unsupervised learning algorithm.

Un-selected is correct

Which of the following is the recommended way to initialize k-means?

Pick a random integer ii from $\{1,\dots,k\}$. Set $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_k = x^{(i)}$.

Pick k distinct random integers $i_1, \dots, i_k$ from $\{1, …, k\}$. Set $\mu_1 = x^{(i_1)}, \mu_2 = x^{(i_2)}, \dots, \mu_k = x^{(i_k)}$.

Pick k distinct random integers $i_1, \dots, i_ki$ from $\{1, …, m\}$.Set $\mu_1 = x^{(i_1)}, \mu_2 = x^{(i_2)}, \dots, \mu_k = x^{(i_k)}$.

Correct

Set every element of $\mu_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$ to a random value between $-\epsilon$ and $\epsilon$, for some small $ \epsilon$.
